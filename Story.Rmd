# Objective and hypothesis of analysis



# Data Preparation

The cell below was run only once to unpack the reviews data from a .gz
compressed folder. The code cell unpacked the data and directly deleted
the compressed files.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(R.utils)
gunzip("Data/reviews.csv.gz")
```

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

listings <- read_csv("Data/listings.csv")

reviews <- read_csv("Data/reviews.csv")

by <- join_by(id == listing_id)
merged <- left_join(x = listings, y = reviews, by)
merged
```

Ideas of questions to answer:

**What have you used it for?**

**For what kind of tasks turned they out to be helpful?**

**How do you check correctness of the answer?**

**What did not work?**

# Requirements

We cross them as soon as fulfilled:

Two or more data sets which need to be joined/merged

**First data set:**

At least few hundred of observations

At least dozen variables

Numeric and categorical variables

Dates ( YYYY-MM-DD) or geographic locations, both are even better

**Second data set:**

Can be simple

Join the two data sets and highlight in your report where you have done
this, showing the line of code where the joining is performed

Ideally different formats and different sources

**Content** Comprehensive analysis which we will present to a hypothetical
client

In depth examination of problem being adressed

PDF or HTML with Rmarkdwon or quarto

Clear and comprehensible to all readers

**Prepare the data for the analysis** Cleaned before they are merged and
analysis begins

You can hide code but highlight in the text where the data is merged

Please explain in words (not as code) what you have done for data
preparation

**Visualize the data appropiately**
Analyse data using summary statistics

Graphs

*Recommendations for plots*
No pie charts

Alpha level to add transparency to points /lines

Not to many stacked bar plots, or not at all (instead maybe line plots)

Show entire range of values, without zooming too much

Same scale on axes

Shall all observations and infos, not just mean and standard deviation

Not too many dimensions in a graph

**Fit the model**
Fit a model and show result + interpet it

Produce graphs (e.g. predictions or residual diagnostics) for your model fits

Possibility: compare several models via CV

**Chapter of choice**
Use new package that was not mentioned in the main part of the course (cant be data
manipulation, visualisation using ggplot2, regular expressions and reporting using Rmarkdown does not count and perform a task that we have not discussed in the course

No new statistical or machine learning method

Method to prepare or display data

**Generative AI**
Quarter to half a page about which tools you have used

What have you used it for? For what kind of tasks turned they out to be
helpful?

How do you check correctness of the answer?

What did not work?

**Sell the story**
Complete, easy to read, thread (what are you doing, why, conclusions, interpretations, overview . . . )

• Source of the data.
• Objectives and hypotheses of the analysis.
• Interpretation of each step.
• Conclusions drawn from the analysis.
• Potential limitations of the study.

**Comments**
Comment a lot

Check coding style

**Additional requirements**
a readme.txt file;

structured folders (e.g. “Data”, “Scripts”, . . . )

the data set analysed

the Rmarkdown file (.Rmd) (or quarto file)

the PDF or HTML output file

not more than 25 pages
