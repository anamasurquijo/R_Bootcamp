# Data Preparation

The cell below was run only once to unpack the reviews data from a .gz compressed folder. The code cell unpacked the data and directly deleted the compressed files.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(R.utils)
gunzip("Data/reviews.csv.gz")
```

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

listings <- read_csv("Data/listings.csv")

reviews <- read_csv("Data/reviews.csv")

by <- join_by(id == listing_id)
merged <- left_join(x = listings, y = reviews, by)
merged
```
